# ExotiCar
Project made as an assigment on a Udemy Course. It's my first proper website although it's only a single page.
It gave me a lot of experience on how to properly place everything on the website as it has multiple tables, superposing text over a image,
2 columns with text and a gradient as a background, a button, elements that change when you hover and many more.

I received a file in format .psd for Photoshop and the images and had to recreate the website.
